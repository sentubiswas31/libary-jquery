               <h4>What is MVC framework?</h4>
               <p>The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application.</p>
               <ul>
                    <li>The Model is the part of the application that handles the logic for the application data.
               Often model objects retrieve data (and store data) from a database.</li>
                    <li>The View is the parts of the application that handles the display of the data.
               Most often the views are created from the model data.</li>
                    <li>The Controller is the part of the application that handles user interaction.
               Typically controllers read data from a view, control user input, and send input data to the model.</li>
               </ul>
               <h4>What is npm?</h4>
               <p>Package manager. Installs, publishes and manages node programs.to manage dependencies in your projects; and share & receive feedback with others.</p>
               <h4>Is javascript language?</h4>
               <p>Yes</p>
               <h4>What is Javascript?</h4>
               <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
               <h4>JavaScript compared to Java</h4>
               JavaScript  Java
               <p>Object-oriented. No distinction between types of objects. Inheritance is through the prototype mechanism, and properties and methods can be added to any object dynamically.  Class-based. Objects are divided into classes and instances with all inheritance through the class hierarchy. Classes and instances cannot have properties or methods added dynamically.</p>
               <p>Variable data types are not declared (dynamic typing).  Variable data types must be declared (static typing).</p>
               Cannot automatically write to hard disk.  Can automatically write to hard disk.
               JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set.
               <h4>What is variable?</h4>
               <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
               <h4>What is Closure function in JavaScript?</h4>
               <p>A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables—scope chain. The closure has three scope chains: it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets), it has access to the outer function's variables, and it has access to the global variables</p>
               -----
               <p>A closure is much like an object. It gets instantiated whenever you call a function. The scope of a closure in JavaScript is lexical, which means that everything that is contained within the function the closure belongs to, has access to any variable that is in it.</p>
               <h4>How to conver strings to numbers?</h4>
               <p>parseInt()</p>
               <p>parseFloat()</p>
               <h4>What are JavaScript types?</h4>
               <p>Following are the JavaScript types:</p>
               <p>Number <br/>
               String  
               Boolean<br/>
               Function<br/>
               Object<br/>
               Null<br/>
               Undefined</p>
               <h4>What do mean by NULL in Javascript?</h4>
               <p>The NULL value is used to represent no value or no object.  It implies no object or null string, no valid boolean value, no number and no array object.</p>
               <h4>What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?</h4>
               <p>Following are looping structures in Javascript:</p>
               <p>For<br/>
               While<br/>
               do-while loops</p>
               <h4>What is the use of type of operator?</h4>
               <p>‘Typeof’ is an operator which is used to return a string description of the type of a variable.</p>
               <h4>What is negative infinity?</h4>
               <p>Negative Infinity is a number in JavaScript which can be derived by dividing negative number by zero.</p>
               <h4>Which company developed JavaScript?</h4>
               <p>Netscape is the software company who developed JavaScript.</p>
               <h4>The Web Console</h4>
               <p>The Web Console shows you information about the currently loaded Web page, and also includes a command line that you can use to execute JavaScript expressions in the current page.</p>
               <h4>What are undeclared and undefined variables?</h4>
               <p>Undeclared variables are those that do not exist in a program and are not declared. If the program tries to read the value of an undeclared variable, then a runtime error is encountered.</p>
               <p>Undefined variables are those that are declared in the program but have not been given any value. If the program tries to read the value of an undefined variable, an undefined value is returned.</p>
               <h4>What is a prompt box?</h4>
               <p>A prompt box is a box which allows the user to enter input by providing a text box.  Label and box will be provided to enter the text or number.</p>
               <h4>What is ‘this’ keyword in JavaScript?</h4>
               <p>‘This’ keyword is used to point at the current object in the code. For instance: If the code is presently at an object created by the help of the ‘new’ keyword, then ‘this’ keyword will point to the object being created.</p>
               <h4>Explain the working of timers in JavaScript? Also elucidate the drawbacks of using the timer, if any?</h4>
               <p>Timers are used to execute a piece of code at a set time or also to repeat the code in a given interval of time. This is done by using the functions setTimeout, setInterval and clearInterval.</p>
               <p>The setTimeout(function, delay) function is used to start a timer that calls a particular function after the mentioned delay. The setInterval(function, delay) function is used to repeatedly execute the given function in the mentioned delay and only halts when cancelled. The clearInterval(id) function instructs the timer to stop.</p>
               <p>Timers are operated within a single thread, and thus events might queue up, waiting to be executed.</p>
               <h4>What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?</h4>
               <p>‘ViewState’ is specific to a page in a session.</p>
               <p>‘SessionState’ is specific to user specific data that can be accessed across all pages in the web application.</p>
               <h4>Explain how can you submit a form using JavaScript?</h4>
               <p>To submit a form using JavaScript use document.form[0].submit();</p>
               <p>document.form[0].submit();</p>
               <h4>How can the style/class of an element be changed?</h4>
               <p>It can be done in the following way: </p>
               <p>document.getElementById(“myText”).style.fontSize = “20?;</p>
               Or
               <p>document.getElementById(“myText”).className = “anyclass”;</p>
               <h4>What is the function of delete operator?</h4>
               <p>The functionality of delete operator is used to delete all variables and objects in a program but it cannot delete variables declared with VAR keyword.</p>
               <h4>What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?</h4>
               <p>Alert <br/>
               Confirm and <br/>
               Prompt<p>
               <h4>What is the use of Void(0)?</h4>
               <p>Void(0) is used to prevent the page from refreshing and parameter “zero” is passed while calling.</p>
               <p>Void(0) is used to call another method without refreshing the page.</p>
               <h4>What is the difference between an alert box and a confirmation box?</h4>
               <p>An alert box displays only one button which is the OK button.
               But a Confirmation box displays two buttons namely OK and cancel.</p>
               <h4>What are escape characters?</h4>
               <p>Escape characters (Backslash) is used when working with special characters like single quotes, double quotes, apostrophes and ampersands. Place backslash before the characters to make it display.</p>
               <p>document.write "I m a "good" boy"</p>
               <p>document.write "I m a \"good\" boy"</p>
               <h4>What are JavaScript Cookies?</h4>
               <p>Cookies are the small test files stored in a computer and it gets created when the user visits the websites to store information that they need. Example could be User Name details and shopping cart information from the previous visits.</p>
               <h4>What is pop()method in JavaScript?</h4>
               <p>The pop() method is similar as the shift() method but the difference is that the Shift method works at the start of the array.  Also the pop() method take the last element off of the given array and returns it. The array on which is called is then altered.</p>
               <p>Example:</p>
               <p>var cloths = [“Shirt”, “Pant”, “TShirt”];</p>
               <p>cloths.pop();</p>
               <p>//Now cloth becomes Shirt,Pant</p>
               <h4>Whether JavaScript has concept level scope?</h4>
               <p>No. JavaScript does not have concept level scope. The variable declared inside the function has scope inside the function.</p>
               <h4>What are the two basic groups of dataypes in JavaScript?</h4>
               <p>They are as –</p>
               <p>Primitive <br>
               Reference types.</p>
               <p>Primitive types are number and Boolean data types. </p>
               <p>Reference types are more complex types like strings and dates.</p>
               <h4>Which keyword is used to print the text in the screen?</h4>
               document.write(“Welcome”) is used to print the text – Welcome in the screen.
               <h4>What is the use of blur function?</h4>
               Blur function is used to remove the focus from the specified object.
               <h4>How to find operating system in the client machine using JavaScript?</h4>
               The ‘Navigator.appversion’ is used to find the name of the operating system in the client machine.
               <h4>What are the different types of errors in JavaScript?</h4>
               There are three types of errors:
               <p>Load time errors: Errors which come up when loading a web page like improper syntax errors are known as Load time errors and it generates the errors dynamically.</p>
               <p>Run time errors: Errors that come due to misuse of the command inside the HTML language.</p>
               <p>Logical Errors: These are the errors that occur due to the bad logic performed on a function which is having different operation.</p>
               <h4>What is the way to get the status of a CheckBox?</h4>
               The status can be acquired as follows –
               alert(document.getElementById(‘checkbox1’).checked);
               If the CheckBox will be checked, this alert will return TRUE.
               <h4>How can the OS of the client machine be detected?</h4>
               The navigator.appVersion string can be used to detect the operating system on the client machine.
               <h4>Explain window.onload and onDocumentReady?</h4>
               The onload function is not run until all the information on the page is loaded. This leads to a substantial delay before any code is executed.
               onDocumentReady loads the code just after the DOM is loaded. This allows early manipulation of the code.
               <h4>How will you explain closures in JavaScript? When are they used?</h4>
               Closure is a locally declared variable related to a function which stays in memory when the function has returned.
               For example:
               function greet(message) {
               console.log(message); 
               } 
               function greeter(name, age) { 
               return name + " says howdy!! He is " + age + " years old"; 
               } 
               // Generate the message 
               var message = greeter("James", 23); 
               // Pass it explicitly to greet 
               greet(message); 
               This function can be better represented by using closures 
               function greeter(name, age) { 
               var message = name + " says howdy!! He is " + age + " years old"; 
               return function greet() {
               console.log(message); 
               }; 
               } 
               // Generate the closure 
               var JamesGreeter = greeter("James", 23); 
               // Use the closure 
               JamesGreeter();
               <h4>How can a value be appended to an array?</h4>
               A value can be appended to an array in the given manner –
               arr[arr.length] = value;
               <h4>Explain the for-in loop?</h4>
               The for-in loop is used to loop through the properties of an object.
               The syntax for the for-in loop is –
               for (variable name in object){
               statement or block to execute
               }
               In each repetition, one property from the object is associated to the variable name, and the loop is continued till all the properties of the object are depleted.
               <h4>Describe the properties of an anonymous function in JavaScript?</h4>
               A function that is declared without any named identifier is known as an anonymous function. In general, an anonymous function is inaccessible after its declaration.
               Anonymous function declaration –
               var anon = function() { 
               alert('I am anonymous'); 
               }; 
               anon();
               <h4>What is the difference between .call() and .apply()?</h4>
               The function .call() and .apply() are very similar in their usage except a little difference. .call() is used when the number of the function’s arguments are known to the programmer, as they have to be mentioned as arguments in the call statement. On the other hand, .apply() is used when the number is not known. The function .apply() expects the argument to be an array.
               The basic difference between .call() and .apply() is in the way arguments are passed to the function. Their usage can be illustrated by the given example.
               var someObject = { 
               myProperty : 'Foo', 
               myMethod : function(prefix, postfix) { 
               alert(prefix + this.myProperty + postfix); 
               } 
               }; 
               someObject.myMethod('<', '>'); // alerts '
               <Foo>
               ' 
               var someOtherObject  = { 
               myProperty : 'Bar' 
               }; 
               someObject.myMethod.call(someOtherObject, '<', '>'); // alerts '
               <Bar>
               ' 
               someObject.myMethod.apply(someOtherObject, ['<', '>']); // alerts '
               <Bar>
               '
               <h4>Define event bubbling?</h4>
               JavaScript allows DOM elements to be nested inside each other. In such a case, if the handler of the child is clicked, the handler of parent will also work as if it were clicked too.
               <h4>Is JavaScript case sensitive? Give an example?</h4>
               Yes, JavaScript is case sensitive. For example, a function parseInt is not same as the function Parseint.
               <h4>What boolean operators can be used in JavaScript?</h4>
               The ‘And’ Operator (&&), ‘Or’  Operator (||) and the ‘Not’ Operator (!) can be used in JavaScript.
               *Operators are without the parenthesis.
               <h4>How can a particular frame be targeted, from a hyperlink, in JavaScript?</h4>
               This can be done by including the name of the required frame in the hyperlink using the ‘target’ attribute. 
               <a href=”newpage.htm” target=”newframe”>>New Page</a>
               <h4>What is the role of break and continue statements?</h4>
               Break statement is used to come out of the current loop while the continue statement continues the current loop with a new recurrence.
               <h4>Write the point of difference between web-garden and a web-farm?</h4>
               Both web-garden and web-farm are web hosting systems. The only difference is that web-garden is a setup that includes many processors in a single server while web-farm is a larger setup that uses more than one server.
               <h4>How are object properties assigned?</h4>
               Assigning properties to objects is done in the same way as a value is assigned to a variable. For example, a form object’s action value is assigned as ‘submit’ in the following manner – Document.form.action=”submit”
               <h4>How are DOM utilized in JavaScript?</h4>
               DOM stands for Document Object Model and is responsible for how various objects in a document interact with each other. DOM is required for developing web pages, which includes objects like paragraph, links, etc. These objects can be operated to include actions like add or delete. DOM is also required to add extra capabilities to a web page. On top of that, the use of API gives an advantage over other existing models.
               <h4>How are event handlers utilized in JavaScript?</h4>
               Events are the actions that result from activities, such as clicking a link or filling a form, by the user. An event handler is required to manage proper execution of all these events. Event handlers are an extra attribute of the object. This attribute includes event’s name and the action taken if the event takes place.
               <h4>Explain the role of deferred scripts in JavaScript?</h4>
               By default, the parsing of the HTML code, during page loading, is paused until the script has not stopped executing. It means, if the server is slow or the script is particularly heavy, then the webpage is displayed with a delay. While using Deferred, scripts delays execution of the script till the time HTML parser is running. This reduces the loading time of web pages and they get displayed faster.
               <h4>What are the various functional components in JavaScript?</h4>
               The different functional components in JavaScript are-
               First-class functions: Functions in JavaScript are utilized as first class objects. This usually means that these functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from other functions, assigned to variables or can also be stored in data structures.
               Nested functions: The functions, which are defined inside other functions, are called Nested functions. They are called ‘everytime’ the main function is invoked.
               <h4>Write about the errors shown in JavaScript?</h4>
               JavaScript gives a message if it encounters an error. The recognized errors are –
               Load-time errors: The errors shown at the time of the page loading are counted under Load-time errors. These errors are encountered by the use of improper syntax, and thus are detected while the page is getting loaded.
               Run-time errors: This is the error that comes up while the program is running. It is caused by illegal operations, for example, division of a number by zero, or trying to access a non-existent area of the memory.
               Logic errors: It is caused by the use of syntactically correct code, which does not fulfill the required task. For example, an infinite loop.
               <h4>What are Screen objects?</h4>
               Screen objects are used to read the information from the client’s screen. The properties of screen objects are –
               AvalHeight: Gives the height of client’s screen
               AvailWidth: Gives the width of client’s screen.
               ColorDepth: Gives the bit depth of images on the client’s screen
               Height: Gives the total height of the client’s screen, including the taskbar
               Width: Gives the total width of the client’s screen, including the taskbar
               Explain the unshift() method ?
               This method is functional at the starting of the array, unlike the push(). It adds the desired number of elements to the top of an array. 
               For example –
               var name = [ "john" ]; 
               name.unshift( "charlie" ); 
               name.unshift( "joseph", "Jane" ); 
               console.log(name);
               The output is shown below: 
               [" Jane ", " joseph ", " charlie ", " john "]
               Define unescape() and escape() functions?
               The escape () function is responsible for coding a string so as to make the transfer of the information from one computer to the other, across a network.
               For Example: 
               <script> 
                  document.write(escape(“Hello? How are you!”)); 
               </script>
               Output: Hello%3F%20How%20are%20you%21
               The unescape() function is very important as it decodes the coded string.
               It works in the following way. For example: 
               <script> 
                  document.write(unescape(“Hello%3F%20How%20are%20you%21”)); 
               </script>
               Output:  Hello? How are you!
               <h4>What are the decodeURI() and encodeURI()?</h4>
               EncodeURl() is used to convert URL into their hex coding. And DecodeURI() is used to convert the encoded URL back to normal. 
               <script> 
                  var uri="my test.asp?name=ståle&car=saab"; 
                  document.write(encodeURI(uri)+ "<br>"); 
                  document.write(decodeURI(uri)); 
               </script>
               Output –
               my%20test.asp?name=st%C3%A5le&car=saab
               my test.asp?name=ståle&car=saab
               <h4>What does the following statement declares?</h4>
               var myArray = [[[]]];
               It declares a three dimensional array.

               Property doesn’t exist
               Tell me value?
               var x;
               x = 5;
               x+=5;
               x+= '5'
               x+= 5
