<h4>What is responsive design?</h4><p>
Responsive web design, originally defined by Ethan Marcotte in A List Apart responds to the needs of the users and the devices they’re using. The layout changes based on the size and capabilities of the device. For example, on a phone, users would see content shown in a single column view; a tablet might show the same content in two columns.
</p>
</p><h4>What is pseudo-class?</h4><p>
A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to selectors that specifies a special state of the element to be selected. For example :hover will apply a style when the user hovers over the element specified by the selector.

</p><h4>What is MVC architecture and how to work?</h4><p>
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application.     
     <ul>
          <li>The Model is the part of the application that handles the logic for the application data.</li>
          <li>The View is the parts of the application that handles the display of the data.</li>
          <li>The Controller is the part of the application that handles user interaction.</li>
     </ul>  

</p><h4>What is npm?</h4><p>
Use npm to install, share, and distribute code; manage dependencies in your projects; and share & receive feedback with others.

</p><h4>What is library?</h4><p>

accepted  A library is a collection of functions / objects that serves one particular purpose. you could use a library in a variety of projects.

</p><h4>What is framework? </h4><p>
A framework is a collection of patterns and libraries to help with building an application.

</p><h4>What is API?</h4><p>
An API is an interface for other programs to interact with your program without having direct access.

</p><h4>What is DOM in html?</h4><p>
Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."

</p><h4>What are semantic elements?</h4><p>
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. 
<strong>Examples of </strong>
<ul>
          <li>Non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content. </li>
          <li>Semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <img> - Clearly defines its content. </li>
     </ul>



</p><h4>Is javascript language?</h4><p>
Yes



</p><h4>What is Javascript?</h4><p>
JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

</p><h4>JavaScript compared to Java</h4><p>
<p><strong>JavaScript</strong></p>
<ul>
     <li>Object-oriented. No distinction between types of objects. Inheritance is through the prototype mechanism, and properties and methods can be added to any object dynamically. </li>
     <li>Variable data types are not declared (dynamic typing).</li>
     <li>Cannot automatically write to hard disk.</li>
</ul> 
<p><strong>Java</strong></p>
<ul>
     <li>Class-based. Objects are divided into classes and instances with all inheritance through the class hierarchy. Classes and instances cannot have properties or methods added dynamically. </li>
     <li>Variable data types must be declared (static typing).</li>
     <li>Can automatically write to hard disk.</li>
</ul>
     
</p><h4>What is Instanceof in Javascript?</h4><p>
The instanceof operator tests whether an object has in its prototype chain the prototypeproperty of a constructor.

</p><h4>What is Undefined in javascript?</h4><p>
In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The typeof is also undefined.
<pre>
var person;                  // Value is undefined, type is undefined
Any variable can be emptied, by setting the value to undefined. The type will also be undefined.
person = undefined;          // Value is undefined, type is undefined
</pre>
</p><h4>What is Variables in Javascript?</h4><p>
JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.
var x = 5;

</p><h4>What are JavaScript data types?</h4><p>
Following are the JavaScript types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number</li>
<li>String</li>
<li>Boolean</li>
<li>Function</li>
<li>Object</li>
<li>Null</li>
<li>Undefined</li>
</ul>

<h4>What is typeof in Javascript?</h4><p>
You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable:</p>
<pre>
typeof "John"                // Returns string 
typeof 3.14                    // Returns number
typeof false                   // Returns boolean
typeof [1,2,3,4]             // Returns object
typeof {name:'John', age:34} // Returns object 
</pre>
<p>In JavaScript, an array is a special type of object. Therefore typeof [1,2,3,4] returns object

</p><h4>What is function?</h4><p>
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).</p>
<pre>
function functionName(parameters) {
  code to be executed
}
</pre>
<h4>What is Namespace?</h4><p>
A namespace is a container which allows developers to bundle up functionality under a unique, application-specific name. In JavaScript a namespace is just another object containing methods, properties, and objects.</p>
<pre>
// global namespace
var MYAPP = MYAPP || {};
// sub namespace
MYAPP.event = {};
</pre>
<h4>What is Class in JavaScript?</h4><p>
JavaScript is a prototype-based language and contains no class statement, such as is found in C++ or Java. This is sometimes confusing for programmers accustomed to languages with aclass statement. Instead, JavaScript uses functions as constructors for classes. Defining a class is as easy as defining a function. In the example below we define a new class called Person with an empty constructor.
<pre>var Person = function () {};</pre>

</p><h4>What is object?</h4><p>
Javascript object is an instance of a class and variable too. It can strore multiple values in a single variable. JavaScript objects are written with curly braces.
Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.
<pre>var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"}; </pre>

</p><h4>What is property?</h4><p>
Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object. A JavaScript object is a collection of unordered properties. Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only.
<pre>
<script>
var person = {
    firstname:"John",
    lastname:"Doe",
    age:50,
    eyecolor:"blue"
};
person.firstname + " is " + person.age + " years old.";
</script>
</pre>
</p><h4>What is Method in JavaScript?</h4><p>
Method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. In most respects we can say, it is special kind of function.But  It has two key differences:</p>
<ul>
     <li>
Method is a function associated with an Object (a Constructor Function or Class)
<pre>
console.log('print something')
here log() is a method
console is an object</pre>
     </li>
     <li>
A Method function has access to the data present in its Construction function
<pre>
var a = [];              // a is an object (Arrays are objects in Javascript)
a.push('value')    // push() is a method function of object a
</pre>
     </li>
</ul>





<h4>What is Constructor?</h4><p>
The constructor is called at the moment of instantiation (the moment when the object instance is created). The constructor is a method of the class. In JavaScript the function serves as the constructor of the object, therefore there is no need to explicitly define a constructor method. Every action declared in the class gets executed at the time of instantiation.
<pre>
var Person = function () {
  console.log('instance created');
};

var person1 = new Person();
var person2 = new Person();
</pre>
</p><h4>What is Inheritance? </h4><p>
Inheritance is a way to create a class as a specialized version of one or more classes (JavaScript only supports single inheritance). The specialized class is commonly called the child, and the other class is commonly called the parent. In JavaScript you do this by assigning an instance of the parent class to the child class, and then specializing it. In modern browsers you can also use Object.create to implement inheritance.

</p><h4>What is Encapsulation?</h4><p>
In the previous example, Student does not need to know how the Person class's walk() method is implemented, but still can use that method; the Student class doesn't need to explicitly define that method unless we want to change it. This is called encapsulation, by which every class packages data and methods into a single unit. 

</p><h4>What is Abstraction?   </h4><p>  
Abstraction is a mechanism that allows you to model the current part of the working problem, either by inheritance (specialization) or composition. JavaScript achieves specialization by inheritance, and composition by letting class instances be the values of other objects' attributes.
<pre>
var foo = function () {};
// logs "foo is a Function: true"
console.log('foo is a Function: ' + (foo instanceof Function));

// logs "foo.prototype is an Object: true"
console.log('foo.prototype is an Object: ' + (foo.prototype instanceof Object));
</pre>
</p><h4>What is Ploymorphism?</h4><p>
Just as all methods and properties are defined inside the prototype property, different classes can define methods with the same name; methods are scoped to the class in which they're defined, unless the two classes hold a parent-child relation (i.e. one inherits from the other in a chain of inheritance).

</p><h4>What is array?</h4><p>
An array is a special type of object and variable too. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.<pre>
var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];</pre>

</p><h4>What is closures? </h4><p>
A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables—scope chain. The closure has three scope chains: it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets), it has access to the outer function's variables, and it has access to the global variables

</p><h4>What is prototype?</h4><p>
A prototype is an object from which other objects inherit properties
<pre>
function person(first, last, age, eyecolor) {
    this.firstName = first;
    this.lastName = last;
    this.age = age;
    this.eyeColor = eyecolor;
}
</pre>
</p><h4>What is scope?</h4>
<p>
In JavaScript, scope is the set of variables, objects, and functions you have access to.
Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.
A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL.

</p><h4>What is html event?</h4><p>
HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.
When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.

</p><h4>What is string?</h4><p>
Genrally strings are text and  written wihing single quote and double quote. JavaScript strings are used for storing and manipulating text.

</p><h4>What is parameters?</h4>
<p> 
Function parameters are the names listed in the function definition.
JavaScript function definitions do not specify data types for parameters.
JavaScript functions do not perform type checking on the passed arguments.
JavaScript functions do not check the number of arguments received.

</p><h4>What is cookies?</h4><p>
Cookies are data, stored in small text files, on your computer.
When a web server has sent a web page to a browser, the connection is shut down, and the server forgets everything about the user.
Cookies were invented to solve the problem "how to remember information about the user":
When a user visits a web page, his name can be stored in a cookie.
Next time the user visits the page, the cookie "remembers" his name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Cookies are saved in name-value pairs like: username=John Doe

</p><h4>What is popup Alert?</h4><p>
JavaScript has three kind of popup boxes: Alert box, Confirm box, and Prompt box.

Alert Box
An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.
When an alert box pops up, the user will have to click "OK" to proceed. 
window.alert("sometext");
The window.alert() method can be written without the window prefix.

Confirm Box
A confirm box is often used if you want the user to verify or accept something.
When a confirm box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed. 
If the user clicks "OK", the box returns true. If the user clicks "Cancel", the box returns false.
window.confirm("sometext");
The window.confirm() method can be written without the window prefix.

Prompt Box
A prompt box is often used if you want the user to input a value before entering a page.
When a prompt box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed after entering an input value. 
If the user clicks "OK" the box returns the input value. If the user clicks "Cancel" the box returns null.
window.prompt("sometext","defaultText");
The window.prompt() method can be written without the window prefix.
var person = prompt("Please enter your name", "Harry Potter");
if (person != null) {
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
    "Hello " + person + "! How are you today?";
}

</p><h4>What does the following statement declares?</h4><p>
var myArray = [[[]]];
It declares a three dimensional array.

</p><h4>How are JavaScript and ECMA Script related?</h4><p>
ECMAScript is nothing but another name for JavaScript. Precisely, ECMAScript is the formal name of JavaScript, when XML elements have to be accessed.

</p><h4>What are the encodeURI() and decodeURI()?</h4><p>
EncodeURl() is used to convert URL into their hex coding. And DecodeURI() is used to convert the encoded URL back to normal. 
<script> 
var uri="my test.asp?name=ståle&car=saab"; 
document.write(encodeURI(uri)+ "<br>"); 
document.write(decodeURI(uri)); 
</script>
Output –
my%20test.asp?name=st%C3%A5le&car=saab
my test.asp?name=ståle&car=saab

</p><h4>Define unescape() and escape() functions?</h4><p>
The unescape function returns a string value that contains the contents of charstring. All characters encoded with the %xx hexadecimal form are replaced by their ASCII character set equivalents.

The escape function returns a string value (in Unicode format) that contains the contents of charstring. All spaces, punctuation, accented characters, and any other non-ASCII characters are replaced with %xx encoding, where xx is equivalent to the hexadecimal number representing the character. For example, a space is returned as "%20."

For Example: 
<script> 
document.write(escape(“Hello? How are you!”)); 
</script>
Output: Hello%3F%20How%20are%20you%21

The unescape() function is very important as it decodes the coded string.
It works in the following way. For example: 
<script> 
document.write(unescape(“Hello%3F%20How%20are%20you%21”)); 
</script>
Output:  Hello? How are you!

</p><h4>Explain the unshift() method ?</h4><p>
This method is functional at the starting of the array, unlike the push(). It adds the desired number of elements to the top of an array. 
For example –
var name = [ "john" ]; 
name.unshift( "charlie" ); 
name.unshift( "joseph", "Jane" ); 
console.log(name);
     

The output is shown below: 
[" Jane ", " joseph ", " charlie ", " john "]

</p><h4>What are Screen objects?</h4><p>
Screen objects are used to read the information from the client’s screen. The properties of screen objects are –
AvalHeight: Gives the height of client’s screen
AvailWidth: Gives the width of client’s screen.
ColorDepth: Gives the bit depth of images on the client’s screen
Height: Gives the total height of the client’s screen, including the taskbar
Width: Gives the total width of the client’s screen, including the taskbar

</p><h4>What are the various functional components in JavaScript?</h4><p>
The different functional components in JavaScript are-
First-class functions: Functions in JavaScript are utilized as first class objects. This usually means that these functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from other functions, assigned to variables or can also be stored in data structures.
Nested functions: The functions, which are defined inside other functions, are called Nested functions. They are called ‘everytime’ the main function is invoked.

</p><h4>What boolean operators can be used in JavaScript?</h4><p>
The ‘And’ Operator (&&), ‘Or’  Operator (||) and the ‘Not’ Operator (!) can be used in JavaScript.
*Operators are without the parenthesis.

</p><h4>Is JavaScript case sensitive? Give an example?</h4><p>
Yes, JavaScript is case sensitive. For example, a function parseInt is not same as the function Parseint.

</p><h4>Define event bubbling?</h4><p>
JavaScript allows DOM elements to be nested inside each other. In such a case, if the handler of the child is clicked, the handler of parent will also work as if it were clicked too.

</p><h4>What are the different types of errors in JavaScript?</h4><p>
There are three types of errors:
Load time errors: Errors which come up when loading a web page like improper syntax errors are known as Load time errors and it generates the errors dynamically.
Run time errors: Errors that come due to misuse of the command inside the HTML language.
Logical Errors: These are the errors that occur due to the bad logic performed on a function which is having different operation.

</p><h4>What is the way to get the status of a CheckBox?</h4><p>
The status can be acquired as follows –
alert(document.getElementById(‘checkbox1’).checked);
If the CheckBox will be checked, this alert will return TRUE.

</p><h4>What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?</h4><p>
‘ViewState’ is specific to a page in a session.
‘SessionState’ is specific to user specific data that can be accessed across all pages in the web application.

</p><h4>Explain how can you submit a form using JavaScript?</h4><p>
To submit a form using JavaScript use document.form[0].submit();
document.form[0].submit();

</p><h4>How can the style/class of an element be changed?</h4><p>
It can be done in the following way:
